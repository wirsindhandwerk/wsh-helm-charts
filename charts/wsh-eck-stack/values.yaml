# FIXME: configurable rollover for indexes. 
# can be done per index (the filebeat index is the important one here)
# -> roll over the index every 5GB so that automated rebalancing of data nodes works better,
# which could allow us to better reduce / increase the storage size according to current needs.
# -> purge / delete logs to free up space after x days, 14 should be the default.
